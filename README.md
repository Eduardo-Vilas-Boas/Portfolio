## Built With

My <a href="https://eduardoguerra.tech" target="_blank">personal portfolio</a> which features some of my github projects as well as my resume and technical skills.<br/>

This project was built using these technologies.

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React-Bootstrap
- CSS
- React-i18next

## Features

This project code was adapted from [Soumyajit Behera](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio). I have modified the code to fit my personal needs. The website has the following additional features:

1. Use [React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to make the website multilingual. It is now available in English, Portuguese and French.
2. Added Typescript to the project to improve code quality and maintainability.
3. Replace [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) (which has been discontinued) with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to eliminate some security vulnerabilities and improve performance.
4. Dockerized the project for easy development and deployment.
